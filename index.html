                <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a really cool person. I love many things, and many things love me. Because I am so loveable. 
                   One time I even loved an ant. Not that theres anything wrong with that. Right? You agree, right? 
                   Because theres not. Ants are incredible little creatures with beautiful eyes and legs. 
                   I mean, they are so strong! They can lift stuff up. So yes, I loved an ant once. 
                   Not only that, but I also once locked eyes with a cyclops. I was on the beach in Tahiti. 
                   It was dusk, the sun was setting behind the ocean and I was alone. I sat down in the sand and started 
                   making kissy faces at a crab I saw coming out of its burrow. Thats when I heard a noise like the one someone 
                   makes when theyve just stubbed their toe. I looked up and saw her. Long brown hair, she was wearing a poncho. 
                   It was beautiful. She turned to face me. I didnt mean to, but I gasped. I know she heard it. 
                   I also know she saw me making kissy faces at the crabs. I was embarassed. I wanted to cry. 
                   I wanted to make like the crabs and burrow. I would have burrowed a few feet down and then all the 
                   way back to my room. But I am no crab. Instead I just said "hi." She didnt respond. We stared into 
                   each others eyes for what felt like 5 minutes. Then I slowly got up and backed my way off the beach. 
                   She didnt move once. I made it to my room and got in to bed but could not sleep. Every time I would 
                   fall asleep, I would quickly be awoken by a horrific dream. It was the same dream every time. It was 
                   her on the beach, but it wasnt the beach. It was more like we were on the edge of a volcano. She just 
                   kept staring at me while making this high pitched noise. Like a bird. She started flapping her arms 
                   like she would fly, but she didnt fly. Instead, eventually, her legs just seemed to give out and she 
                   fell into the volcano. Thats when I wake up. I had that dream over and over. When morning finally came 
                   I went back out to the beach and she was still there. Completely motionless. So I walked up to her and 
                   asked if she was alright. No response. She didnt even blink. Her eyes fixed on a point straight ahead 
                   and off into the distance. I asked again, no response. I gave her shoulder a poke. As soon as I made 
                   contact she began gasping for air. She started crying. She told me she had been paralyzed! She said 
                   she had stood there all night trapped in her thoughts! She was shaking and crying. I asked her if I 
                   could help her but she would not look into my eyes. She was trying to keep her eyes closed so as not 
                   to look at me. She wouldnt say why but she left in a hurry. Panicked. She ran off into the distance 
                   and I never saw her again. I left Tahiti 3 days later.</p>

                <h2>Professional Writing</h2>
                <p>Ant - noun - A small insect, often with a sting, that usually lives in a complex social colony with 
                    one or more breeding queens. It is wingless except for fertile adults, which often form large mating swarms,
                    and is proverbial for industriousness. Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the
                    related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera.
